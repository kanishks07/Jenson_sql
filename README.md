📊 Jensen’s SQL Analytics Project
🧠 Project Overview

This project focuses on deriving meaningful business insights from Jensen’s database using SQL.
The goal is to analyze customer behavior, staff performance, inventory management, and store operations through well-structured and optimized queries.

The dataset simulates a retail environment with stores, products, categories, customers, staff, and orders. Using SQL, we answer real-world business questions that a data analyst would typically handle.
